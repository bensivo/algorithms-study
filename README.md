# algorithms-study
A collection of leetcode-style problems

Implemented in the order specified in the neetcode roadmap: https://neetcode.io/roadmap

In most cases, the solutions are implemented on golang. IMO, golang is low-level enough to gain a good understanding of algorithms, but without the added headache of manual memory management.
